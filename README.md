# A Hands-on Workshop on AI and Data Science for Advancing Translational Science

## Day-3 Hands-on Session: Introduction to Machine learning for Tabular Data

### Introduction
This hands-on session will briefly introduce key steps in a typical machine learning workflow to analyze tabular data using models like SVM, where we will handle missing values, class imbalance, and data scaling, followed by model training, evaluation, and interpretation. Additionally, we will explore a tabular foundational deep learning model to analyze the same data and compare its performance and interpretability with classical approaches.
